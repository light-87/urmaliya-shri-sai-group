### Without a proper system, you're dealing with:

**📝 Paper Chaos**
- Inventory registers scattered everywhere
- Lost transaction records
- Can't find last month's data when you need it
- Hours wasted searching for information

**🧮 Manual Calculations**
- Calculating stock by hand - prone to errors
- No idea what's really in stock right now
- Finding out you're out of stock when customer is waiting
- Overstocking or understocking - both cost you money

**💰 Financial Blindness**
- Where is your money going?
- Which customers owe you money?
- Are you making profit or loss this month?
- No clear picture of your business health

**📱 Always at the Factory**
- Can't check stock from home
- Need to physically go to factory for every small thing
- Can't give info to customers when you're away
- Business stops when you're not there

**👥 Staff Dependencies**
- Only YOU know where everything is
- Staff can't help customers without asking you
- Training new staff takes forever
- Information locked in people's heads
